# sportsRentals Project
In this text, we will present a short description of the application we are going to develop this semester, illustrative screenshots, as well as a user story.

## App Description
We have chosen to develop an application for sports rentals. The application will allow users to rent a selection of sporting equipment for their preferred amount of time. 

In the paragraphs below we describe our vision for how our application will function as a finished product.

Users will begin by selecting the date they want their rental period to start. Next, they will choose between our four predefined rental periods. The application will then present the user with the available equipment corresponding to their selected rental period. After the user selects a desired equipment, the page will update to provide the user with information about their rental. 

After making their selections, the user will then have the option to either start over or confirm their rental. If the first option is chosen, the page and all information will clear and the user can start fresh. 

If the second option is selected, the user will be presented with a new page where they will enter their contact information. They will then get the chance to review their rental and contact information and finally confirm their rental. The rental information will then be written and stored to file. This file will be used to keep our equipment availability up to date.
